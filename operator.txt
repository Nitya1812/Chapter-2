2.
What will be the value of x after this code runs?

let x = 10;
x += 5;
ans - 15
3.
What is the result of this comparison:

7 == "7"
Explain your answer --> the result wil be true because " == " is the loose equality operator, and it performs type coercion.

4.

ans - n !== 10

Medium (5-7)
5.
What does the following code output? Why?

let a = 3;
let b = 2;
console.log(a > 2 && b = 50) {
  result = "Pass";
} else {
  result = "Fail";
}

ans -It will show an syntax errorand it won't give output because, b = 50 is an assignment, not a comparison.
--> And you’re also using {  } else {  } without an if statement.

7.
What is the value of msg after this code executes?

let msg = "Hello";
msg += " World!";
ans - "Hello World!"

Hard (8-10)
8.
What will this code print? Explain your answer.

console.log(typeof "123");
console.log(typeof 123);

ans - (a) First it will show string , beacuse "123" is wrapped in quotes, so it is a             a string literal.
    (b) Secondly ,It will show string , because 123 without quotes is a number literal.

9.
Write a statement that checks if arr is an array using an operator.
ans - NOT DONE

10.
What is the output of this code? Why?

let x = 5;
let y = "5";
console.log(x === y);
console.log(x == y);

ans -  (a) false , === is the strict equality operator.
It compares both value and type.
       (b) true , == is the loose equality operator.
It performs type coercion.
